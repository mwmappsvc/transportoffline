Hello!
This text is designed to get you up to speed with my Android Studio project.

Title and Project Name:
This is my Android Studio Project: TransportOffline
(When creating this project, I chose Kotlin and Android 5.0)

Project is saving to github public repository:
https://github.com/mwmappsvc/transportoffline

Purpose:
This project is designed to work with Denver Colorado's RTD, GTFS data for
Offline bus schedules and optionally work on route planning when everything
else is working. It is a private app to be installed by APK and will not
be put on the Play store.

Reasons:
I and some of my friends don't have access to the Internet on our phones
when traveling in Denver by Bus and/or Train

App Functionality:
The App as it is designed at present, does the following:

Upon App launch, the database is copied from assets folder with
only the Tables built, it starts with no data as we will be downloading and importing
the latest GTFS file.

HomeActivity.kt is our "Main Activity"
DatabaseHelper.kt (Database copy and Database\SQL checks)
activity_home.xml = layout

Here is the AndroidManifest:

<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools">

    <!-- Add this line for INTERNET permission -->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />

    <application
        android:allowBackup="true"
        android:dataExtractionRules="@xml/data_extraction_rules"
        android:fullBackupContent="@xml/backup_rules"
        android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
        android:label="@string/app_name"
        android:roundIcon="@mipmap/ic_launcher_round"
        android:supportsRtl="true"
        android:theme="@style/Theme.TransportOffline"
        tools:targetApi="31">

        <activity
            android:name=".WelcomeActivity"
            android:exported="true"
            android:label="@string/app_name"
            android:theme="@style/Theme.TransportOffline">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>

        <activity
            android:name=".HomeActivity"
            android:exported="true"
            android:label="@string/app_name"
            android:theme="@style/Theme.TransportOffline" />

        <activity
            android:name=".SettingsActivity"
            android:exported="true"
            android:label="@string/settings_activity_label"
            android:theme="@style/Theme.TransportOffline" />

        <activity
            android:name=".UpdateDatabaseActivity"
            android:exported="true"
            android:label="@string/update_database_activity_label"
            android:theme="@style/Theme.TransportOffline" />

        <activity
            android:name=".LoggingActivity"
            android:exported="true"
            android:label="@string/logging_activity_label"
            android:theme="@style/Theme.TransportOffline" />
    </application>
</manifest>

For the user, the app launches with a Welcome Screen
WelcomeActivity.kt
activity_welcome.xml

Which is a one time page that walks the user through updating the database.
which takes us to the Update Database Page.

UpdatedDatabaseActivity.kt
activity_update_database.xml

Update Database page Has one Button at the top that says 'Start Update'
On the bottom of the page we have a button that says 'Configure URL'
[Reminder to move 'configure url' button to Settings page]
[Reminder to replace that button at the bottom with 'Settings' button to open Settings page.]

On press of 'Start Update'
We being background processes = Download GTFS data, Verify, compare, import data in database

Components include:
GtfsDownloader.kt
GtfsExtractor.kt
DataImporter.kt

So that brings us to the Home Page
HomeActivity.kt is our "Main Activity"
activity_home.xml = layout

This our primary page that would be displayed upon launch assuming our first welcome page completed.
Here we have our Search field for looking up Bus Stop Number or Bus Stop street
And we have a Settings gear icon on the top right to go to the Settings Page

Home Page components:
DataQuery.kt
BusScheduleAdapter.kt
item_bus_schedule.xml
item_bus_stop.xml

Additional components that may need to be moved back into one of the main classes:
BusStop.kt
BusSchedule.kt

Query and RecyclerView:
We will look up Bus Stop Number or Street name from Stops Table
Followed by linking to the Stop_times Table using stop_id
Here we can pull our arrival_time and bus number (stop_sequence)

Prior attempts at this query, would try and link all the other tables in order
to perform the more complex task of pulling bus stop info and route data.
Doing it this way, results in failure to display data from our query.
The current thought, it after the main lookup is done linking stops and stop_times.
The user selects the bus schedule from the list and then in an different query process,
we can link other tables to collect bus stop names and route data.

Any time we made changes to query, we likely will break app functionality,
so we have to proceed incrementally when possible to understand where the break occurs.

I can give you our sql table structure that the database was created with upon request.
I can give you samples of the GTFS text files upon request

Moving on to the other portions of the App:

Settings Page

SettingsActivity.kt
activity_settings.xml

Currently we have Two buttons. Update Database
Which opens the Update Database page we discussed above

The other button is the Logging Button
loggingActivity.kt
activity_logging.xml

[We want to move the 'configure url' button to this Settings page as well]
[Currently 'configure url' is on the Update Database page]
Let's take the configureurlbutton code out of the updatedatabaseactivity
Then, create AppConfigurationActivity, this page will be for any
app configuration components.  Which currently will only be Configure URL,
but we will add other items here as needed.

Misc Items

Values:
colors.xml
strings.xml
styles.xml
themes.xml

assets:
bus_schedule.db

drawable:
gear.png (settings icon)
ic_search (search icon; not currently used)

Notes on how to interact with me on chat:
I'm a newbie coder, that mostly wants to learn by watching you build my app for me.
over time I will see how the process is done and then at a later time learn syntax.
When possible provide entire code, otherwise give explicit details as to where to place
the code given.

Final Note: Any code suggestions should be done only after you have a copy of the
current code we are running; therefore please ask for me to give you the code when needed
to develop plan of action, make changes, troubleshoot, etc.
