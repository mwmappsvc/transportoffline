Hello!
This text is designed to get you up to speed with my project,
as well as provide you github links to code.

Title and Project Name:
This is my Android Studio Project: TransportOffline
(When creating this project, I chose Kotlin and Android 5.0)

Purpose:
This project is designed to work with Denver Colorado's RTD, GTFS data for
Offline bus schedules and optionally work on route planning when everything
else is working. It is a private app to be installed by APK and will not
be put on the Play store.

Reasons:
I and some of my friends don't have access to the Internet on our phones
when traveling in Denver by Bus and/or Train

App Functionality:
The App as it is designed at present, does the following:

Upon App launch, the database is copied from assets folder with
only the Tables built, no data.

Home Page = HomeActivity.kt
https://github.com/mwmappsvc/transportoffline/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/mwmapps/transportoffline/HomeActivity.kt

Import of data is done within the App by way of:
 Settings | Update Database | Start Update

 Settings Page = SettingsActivity.kt

 The app has a field for the URL of the RTD GTFS download file.
 That field is configurable under the settings page in case it changes.
